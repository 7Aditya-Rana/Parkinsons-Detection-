The dataset used in this project was collected through in-person visits to an old age home,
where eye-movement videos were recorded from elderly participants after obtaining informed consent.
Since the data contains sensitive visual and behavioral information, it cannot be made publicly available.
All data collection and usage procedures were carried out in accordance with ethical guidelines and applicable data protection regulations.
